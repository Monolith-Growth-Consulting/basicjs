## Javascript Basics

This is a compilation of code snippets taken from translating Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way.

This is meant to teach beginning programmers the basics of javascript.

The commits are organized by sessions / internal trainings that we've done.

The code is open to the public; the recordings are private for the company.

## Where to paste the code

A compatible online IDE such as [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) is recommended. Just paste the javsacript code there, and it'll work!
